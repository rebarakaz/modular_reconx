- **Time Windows**: Respect agreed-upon testing windows
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed logs of all activities

### 3. Security Research

- **Own Infrastructure**: Test on systems you own or control
- **Lab Environments**: Use isolated test environments
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices
- **Academic Use**: Cite properly and follow institutional ethics guidelines

### 4. Educational Purposes

- **Controlled Environments**: Use dedicated lab setups (e.g., DVWA, HackTheBox)
- **Training Platforms**: Leverage legal training platforms
- **Capture The Flag (CTF)**: Participate in authorized CTF competitions

## ❌ Prohibited Activities

### Illegal Actions

- ❌ Scanning targets without explicit authorization
- ❌ Accessing systems you don't own or have permission to test
- ❌ Violating Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) or equivalent laws
- ❌ Bypassing security controls without authorization
- ❌ Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- ❌ Data exfiltration or unauthorized access

### Unethical Behavior

- ❌ Ignoring bug bounty program rules and scope
- ❌ Selling vulnerabilities to malicious actors
- ❌ Public disclosure without responsible disclosure period
- ❌ Using findings for blackmail or extortion
- ❌ Harassing or threatening system owners

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Before Scanning

1. **Verify Authorization**: Confirm you have explicit permission
2. **Read the Rules**: Understand scope, limitations, and requirements
3. **Check Legal Status**: Ensure compliance with local laws
4. **Plan Your Approach**: Use appropriate flags to minimize impact

### During Scanning

1. **Use Rate Limiting**: `--rate-limit 1.0` to avoid overwhelming targets
2. **Respect Infrastructure**: Use `--passive-only` when appropriate
3. **Monitor Impact**: Watch for signs of system stress
4. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed logs of your activities

### After Scanning

1. **Secure Your Data**: Protect scan results and findings
2. **Report Responsibly**: Follow proper disclosure procedures
3. **Delete Sensitive Data**: Remove unnecessary data after reporting
4. **Follow Up**: Respond to questions from program owners

## 🛡️ Privacy & Data Protection

### Handling Sensitive Information

- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Redact from reports
- **Credentials**: Never store or share discovered credentials
- **Metadata**: Be aware that metadata can contain sensitive info
- **EXIF Data**: GPS coordinates and personal info in images

### Data Storage

- Encrypt scan results containing sensitive information
- Use secure storage for reports and findings
- Delete data when no longer needed
- Follow GDPR/CCPA requirements if applicable

## 📚 Legal Considerations

### Know Your Jurisdiction

Different countries have different laws regarding security testing:

- **United States**: Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
- **European Union**: GDPR, Computer Misuse Act
- **United Kingdom**: Computer Misuse Act 1990
- **Australia**: Cybercrime Act 2001

**Disclaimer**: This is not legal advice. Consult with a lawyer if unsure about the legality of your activities.

### Safe Harbor Provisions

Many bug bounty programs provide "safe harbor" protection:

- Legal protection for good-faith security research
- Protection from DMCA Section 1201 claims
- Clear guidelines on acceptable testing methods

Always verify the program's safe harbor policy before testing.
