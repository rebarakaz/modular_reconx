## Project Overview
Modular ReconX is a comprehensive OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool built in Python for performing complete reconnaissance on domains or websites. It provides security professionals, penetration testers, and researchers with a powerful suite of tools for gathering intelligence using open-source techniques.

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Enhanced WordPress Scanner**
   - Automatic plugin detection via multiple methods (CSS/JS files, readme.txt, HTML signatures, REST API)
   - Version extraction and vulnerability assessment
   - Integration with WPScan API for vulnerability data
   - Detailed reporting with vulnerability information and fix versions

2. **Certificate Transparency Log Monitoring**
   - Multi-source CT log querying (crt.sh, CertSpotter, BufferOver)
   - Enhanced subdomain discovery beyond traditional wordlist-based enumeration
   - Passive reconnaissance capabilities
   - Recently issued certificate discovery

3. **Internationalization**
   - Translated all Indonesian text to English
   - Made the tool accessible to an international audience

4. **Email Breach Checking**
   - Integrated Mozilla Monitor as a free alternative to HIBP
   - Fallback mechanism when HIBP API key is not available

5. **Offline Vulnerability Database**
   - NVD database support for offline vulnerability checking
   - Database update script for maintaining current vulnerability data

6. **Package Installation**
   - Added setup.py for easier installation as a Python package
   - Command-line tools (reconx, modular-reconx) for global access
   - Proper dependency management

7. **Documentation Updates**
   - Comprehensive README with all new features
   - Updated installation instructions
   - Author credits included
